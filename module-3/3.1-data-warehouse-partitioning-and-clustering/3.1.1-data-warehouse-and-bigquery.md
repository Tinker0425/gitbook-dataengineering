### Definitions

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="OLTP" %}
OLTP: Online transaction processing

Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) refers to database systems designed to manage and process real-time transaction data, typically for operational applications. These systems handle tasks like order processing, inventory management, and customer interactions, where quick, reliable processing is crucial. In contrast to OLAP (Online Analytical Processing), which focuses on analyzing large datasets for decision-making, OLTP is all about immediate, transactional data processing.

**Example 1**: An e-commerce website using OLTP to process customer orders in real-time.\
**Example 2**: A bankâ€™s ATM system that instantly processes withdrawals and deposits.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="OLAP" %}
Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a computing approach designed for quickly answering multi-dimensional analytical queries, often used in business intelligence. Unlike OLTP, which focuses on transaction processing, OLAP helps in complex data analysis for areas like sales reporting, budgeting, and forecasting. It enables users to analyze large datasets and perform tasks such as trend analysis and data mining.

**Example 1**: A company using OLAP to analyze sales performance across different regions and time periods.\
**Example 2**: Financial analysts using OLAP to forecast next quarter's revenues based on historical data.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Data Warehouse" %}
A data warehouse (DW or EDW) is a centralized system used for reporting and data analysis, playing a key role in business intelligence. It stores both current and historical data from various operational systems, like sales or marketing, and organizes it for easy querying and reporting by analysts and managers. Data in the warehouse often undergoes cleansing and transformation before being used for insights and decision-making.

Examples of popular data warehouses include Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics.

{% tab title="BigQuery" %}
"BigQuery is a managed, [serverless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless) [data warehouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse) product by [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google), offering [scalable analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis) over large quantities of data. It is a _Platform as a Service_ ([PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing#Platform_as_a_service_\(PaaS\))) that supports querying using a dialect of [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). It also has built-in [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) capabilities." Wiki [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigQuery)

BigQuery has some public tables and you can search for them:
