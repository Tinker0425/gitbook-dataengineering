{% @github-files/github-code-block url="https://github.com/Tinker0425/de-zoomcamp-my-work/tree/master/module-04/homework" %}

:warning: I do not recommend these linked below because for the HW the data is different...[https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/city-of-new-york/nyc-tlc-trips?project=taxi-rides-ny-448101](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/city-of-new-york/nyc-tlc-trips?project=taxi-rides-ny-448101); [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mork172sK\_c\&embeds\_referring\_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.iframe.ly%2F\&source\_ve\_path=OTY3MTQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mork172sK_c\&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.iframe.ly%2F\&source_ve_path=OTY3MTQ)

1. Open a free developer dbt cloud account following [this link](https://www.getdbt.com/signup/)
2. Following these instructions to connect to your BigQuery instance in dbt
   1. More detailed instructions in [dbt\_cloud\_setup.md](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/04-analytics-engineering/dbt_cloud_setup.md)
   2. :warning: I recommend creating a dataset in BigQuery for your dbt model info, that way you can set-up the correct geographical location there! Otherwise, there may be a US vs. EU mismatch. Then when you connect to BigQuery in dbt, just use the dataset name you already created.
3. Follow the below link to connect to Github - you can use SSH found above in 3a
