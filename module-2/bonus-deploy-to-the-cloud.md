Now that we've got our ETL pipeline working both locally and in the cloud, we can deploy Kestra to the cloud so it can continue to orchestrate our ETL pipelines monthly with our configured schedules, We'll cover how you can install Kestra on Google Cloud in Production, and automatically sync and deploy your workflows from a Git repository.
