:warning: You will need green and yellow taxi data in your BigQuery in GCP from the previous video to use dbt here

:white\_check\_mark: requirements to move forward with this setup, ensuring you have the necessary permissions and access credentials for BigQuery. Additionally, ensure you have followed the guidelines for setting up dbt with your cloud provider as outlined in the documentation.

Our 'Postgres' Database now becomes what we put in BigQuery in the cloud, hence the format of the dbt yaml looking similar to that in 2.2.2 dtb video.
