If you stopped from the last video, be sure to restart <mark style="background-color:blue;">Docker</mark> and open <mark style="background-color:purple;">Kestra</mark>
{% endhint %}

This video does not go through writing the script, so you will need to grab it from the repo.

:exclamation:I was having issues in the next video that talks about dbt, so I updated my docker-compose.yml. ALSO have your docker-compose.yml live outside of a sub-directory and in your main directory, because you want to run the same one in each of the upcoming videos. See those files used here

But, how do we backfill the data from the past? Well once we have this script saved on <mark style="background-color:purple;">Kestra</mark>, we can go to the 'Triggers' tab and there is a 'Backckfill Executions' that should be highlighted in <mark style="background-color:purple;">purple</mark>. Click that:

:white\_check\_mark: Once your execution is complete, you should now see the months you backfilled in <mark style="background-color:yellow;">pgAdmin</mark>

Be sure to backfill a few months for BOTH yellow and green taxi to prepare for the next video
