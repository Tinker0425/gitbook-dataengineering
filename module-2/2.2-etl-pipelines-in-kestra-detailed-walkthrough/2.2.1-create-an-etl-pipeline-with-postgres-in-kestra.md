This introductory flow is added just to demonstrate a simple data pipeline which extracts data via HTTP REST API, transforms that data in Python and then queries it using DuckDB. For this stage, a new separate Postgres database is created for the exercises.

**Note:** Check that `pgAdmin` isn't running on the same ports as Kestra. If so, check out the [FAQ](https://github.com/Tinker0425/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/02-workflow-orchestration#troubleshooting-tips) at the bottom of the README.
