:expressionless: I was unable to get this to run correctly. I tried a number of different docker-compose.yml files and set-ups. The last one I used was Will's version here:

{% @github-files/github-code-block url="https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/pull/628" %}

and then the yaml code for flow 3 provided by the course. I am getting the error:

```
Database Error in model stg_green_tripdata (models/staging/stg_green_tripdata.sql)
 relation "public.green_tripdata" does not exist
 LINE 13: from "postgres-zoomcamp"."public"."green_tripdata"
 ^
 compiled code at target/run/taxi_rides_ny/models/staging/stg_green_tripdata.sql
```

I checked past docker-config files, I deleted all of my containers, I moved things to a new directory, I went back a video and used Will's docker-compose.yml to backfill the taxis (which works fine), but I can't get dbt to fully work. I checked slack and FAQ with no full answers to this question. Julia had the same issue I am having, but it doesn't look like it was fully solved:

I spent way too much time trying to work with this, and am moving on from here. I created a slack question and will updated this page when I solve my issue.
