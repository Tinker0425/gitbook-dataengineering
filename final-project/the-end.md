# THE END

### Thank you!

Thank you for coming along on this ride with me! I plan on trying other courses shortly, so follow along with my other journeys below.\
\
Overall, I enjoyed the main outcome of this course. There were a good amount of 'growing pains' as there were older videos but versions had been updated so the directions were not a complete match. I would not consider this a beginner course. I really enjoyed the slack community and made a ton of new date engineering friends!
