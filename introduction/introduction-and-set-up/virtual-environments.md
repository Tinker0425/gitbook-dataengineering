# Virtual Environments

My first error in the course was solved due to a virtual environment issue. So let's talk about setting up a virtual environment, specifically conda on a Mac.

> I will add that it is my understanding that a new virtual environment is encouraged for each module - though there may be one module that does not need one? I will update this page once I know the answer!

### Brew install iterm2

It was recommended to me to use iterm2&#x20;

1. Do you have homebrew installed?
   1. Open a terminal window and type

```bash
brew
```

&#x20;       b. If yes, continue. If no, installl homebrew - details [https://docs.brew.sh/Installation](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)

2. brew install iterm2

&#x20;

### Installing Conda





python -V

conda create -n pyingest python=3.12

conda activate pyingest

pip install pandas sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary jupyterlab
