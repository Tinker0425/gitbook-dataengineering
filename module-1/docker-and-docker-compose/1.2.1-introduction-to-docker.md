{% hint style="info" %}
To work through this video you will need Docker :whale2: downloaded, a terminal window :black\_small\_square:, and a code editor :pencil: of choice (Pycharm for me). Please see the '[Introduction](../../introduction/introduction-and-set-up/)' section if you need more info.
{% endhint %}

:writing\_hand: In this video, we learn about what Docker is, get a pipeline overview, and learn about docker container and docker image. Then we work through an example.

### What is...

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Docker?" %}
"Docker helps developers build, share, run, and verify applications anywhere — without tedious environment configuration or management." - [https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Container?" %}
"Simply put, containers are isolated processes for each of your app's components. Each component - the frontend React app, the Python API engine, and the database - runs in its own isolated environment, completely isolated from everything else on your machine." - [https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container/)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Image?" %}
"If you’re new to container images, think of them as a standardized package that contains everything needed to run an application, including its files, configuration, and dependencies. These packages can then be distributed and shared with others." - [https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/build-and-push-first-image/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/build-and-push-first-image/)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Tag?" %}
"A tag is a custom, human-readable identifier that's typically used to identify different versions or variants of an image. If no tag is specified, `latest` is used by default." - [https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/build-tag-and-publish-an-image/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/build-tag-and-publish-an-image/)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Building a Container Image

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Dockerfile

:pencil: Create a new 'Dockerfile' in your code editor. I recommend adding the Docker 'plug in' to your editor.

```
// Some code
```

:hammer\_pick: You are likely using an updated version of python, so I would recommend using that in the Dockerfile





{% embed url="https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/" %}

{% embed url="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/writing-a-dockerfile/" %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Docker build

:black\_large\_square:&#x20;

```bash
docker build -t {image_name}:{tag_name} .
```

-t is used to denote adding a tag

Replace image\_name & tag\_name

a build command that uses the current directory (`.`) as a build context

"The final `.` in the command provides the path or URL to the [build context](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/context/#what-is-a-build-context). At this location, the builder will find the `Dockerfile` and other referenced files."

[https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/build-tag-and-publish-an-image/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/building-images/build-tag-and-publish-an-image/)




{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Docker run

:black\_large\_square:

```bash
docker run -it
```




{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}





### Docker Terminal Commands

docker build -t

docker run -d -p 8080:80 docker/welcome-to-docker

docker run -it === to run an image...image:tag

docker compose

exit = to exit container

docker ps - to view container



view containers

stop containers

front end!











:white\_check\_mark: What we learned

:bookmark: A link I recommend bookmarking

:no\_entry: Where I recommend not pausing your workflow

:recycle: Where we will recall something from a pervious lesson



:link: Additional Helpful links

:books: I recommend working through the Docker site Intro & workshop if you're still confused on what Docker is
